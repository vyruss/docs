You can upgrade to a patch release with a simple in place upgrade. A minor release upgrade such as upgrading from 1.15 to 1.16 requires additional steps.

To upgrade to a new minor release:

1. Stop the service for the currently installed version.
2. Install the new release.

   For Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8 on x86_64:
   ```shell
   dnf -y upgrade edb-pgbouncer<xx>
   ```

   For RHEL/CentOS 7 on ppc64le:
   ```shell
   yum -y upgrade edb-pgbouncer<xx>
   ```
   
   For SLES:
   ```shell
   zypper -n update edb-pgbouncer<xx>
   ```

   For Ubuntu/Debian:
   ```shell
   apt-get -y upgrade edb-pgbouncer<xx>
   ```

   Where &lt;xx> is the EDB PgBouncer minor version you want to upgrade to.

3. If you have any custom configurations in the `edb-pgbouncer.ini` and `userlist.txt` files for the previously installed version, copy them from the versions of those files where the customization were made and paste them to the corresponding files for the release you just installed.
