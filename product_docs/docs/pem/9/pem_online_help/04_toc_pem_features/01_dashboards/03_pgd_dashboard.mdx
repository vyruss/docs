The `PGD Monitoring Dashboards` display the information about replication activities of the `PGD Nodes` in a `PGD Group`. There are three different dashboards for PGD:

-   PGD Admin Dashboard
-   PGD Group Monitoring Dashboard
-   PGD Node Monitoring Dashboard

To view the details on these dashboards, you must enable the probes on the PGD Nodes. By default, the [PGD Probes](../12_pem_manage_probes/03_pem_probe_config/01_pem_probes/#pgd_probes) are disabled. To enable the probes, highlight the name of the PGD Node in the PEM client browser tree control, and select `Manage Probes...` from the `Management` menu. Use the `Manage Probes..` tab to enable to Probes.

## PGD Admin Dashboard

To view the details on `PGD Admin Dashboard` enable the following probes:

-   PGD Group Camo Details
-   PGD Group Locks
-   PGD Group Raft Details
-   PGD Group Versions Details
-   PGD Node Summary
-   PGD Worker
-   PGD Worker Errors

Then highlight the `PGD Node` in the PEM client browser and select the `PGD Admin` from the `Dashboards` drop down menu.

-   The `Camo Transactions Resolved` column displays if there are any pending and unresolved CAMO transactions.
-   The `Apply LSN` column displays the latest position reported as replayed.
-   The `Receive LSN` column displays the latest LSN of any change or message received.
-   The `Apply Queue Size` column displays the difference between apply_lsn and receive_lsn in bytes.
