PGD (Bi-Directional Replication) is a PostgreSQL extension that provides a multi-master replicaton between the Postgres clusters. Before you monitor PGD through PEM console, you must ensure that your PGD nodes are up and running. For more information about PGD please visit the [EDB Doc Website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd/latest/).

You can configure PEM to display status information about one or more PGD Nodes via dashboards from PEM 8.1.0 and PGD 3.7.9 onwards.

To configure PEM to monitor `PGD Nodes`, use the PEM Web Client to create a server definition. Use the tabs on the [New Server Registration](../01_toc_pem_getting_started/07_pem_define_connection) dialog to specify general connection properties for the PGD Node with the following exceptions:

-   Specify the PGD-enabled database name in the `Database` field of the `PEM Agent` tab.
-   Specify the user having `pgd_monitor` or `pgd_superuser` role in the `username` field of the `PEM Agent` tab.

After saving the server definition, the PGD Node will be included in the list of servers under the PEM Server Directory in the PEM client object browser tree. You can monitor the `PGD Nodes` from the [PGD dashboards](01_dashboards/03_pgd_dashboard).

To include monitoring information on the PGD dashboards, you must enable the relative probes for each PGD Group. You can see the complete list of PGD Probes [here](12_pem_manage_probes/03_pem_probe_config/01_pem_probes/#pgd_probes).

To enable a probe, right click on the node name, and select `Manage Probes` from the `Management` menu.

To monitor the PGD Node, right click on the name of the PGD Node in the Object browser tree control and navigate through the Dashboards menu to select `PGD Admin` or `PGD Group Monitoring` or `PGD Node Monitoring` dashboard.
