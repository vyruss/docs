PEM displays performance statistics through a number of dashboards. Each dashboard contains a series of summary views that contain charts, graphs, and tables that display the statistics related to the selected object.

## Dashboards overview

The PEM client displays the Global Overview dashboard when it connects to the PEM server. Additional dashboards provide statistical information about monitored objects. 

### Opening dashboards

You can open a dashboard using either of these techniques:

-   Select an active dashboard name from the **Management > Dashboards** menu.
-   Right-click the name of a monitored object in the tree and select the name of the dashboard to review from the **Dashboards** menu.

Each dashboard is displayed on the **Monitoring** tab in the main panel of the client window. After opening a dashboard, you can navigate to other dashboards in the same tab.

Each dashboard header includes navigation menus that allow you to navigate to other dashboards. Use your browser's forward and back icons to scroll through previously viewed dashboards. Use **Refresh** to update the current dashboard.

### Alerts dashboard

The Alerts dashboard displays the currently triggered alerts. If opened from the Global Overview, the dashboard displays the current alerts for all monitored nodes on the system. If opened from a node in a server, the report shows alerts related to that node and all monitored objects that reside below that object in the tree.

## Dashboard configuration

Options on the Dashboard Configuration dialog box allow you to link the timelines of all of the line graphs on the dashboard. To open the Dashboard Configuration dialog box, select **Settings** in the dashboard header.

Use the Dashboard Configuration dialog box to control attributes of the charts displayed on the dashboard:

-   Set **Link timelines of all the line charts** to **Enable** to apply the specified timeline to line graphs displayed on the dashboard. If set to **Disable**, your preferences are preserved for later use but don't modify the amount of data displayed.
-   Use the **Days** selector to specify the number of days of gathered data to display on line graphs.
-   Use the **Hour(s)** selector to specify the number of hours of gathered data to display on line graphs.
-   Select **Remember configuration for this dashboard** to apply the customized time span to only the current dashboard only. Leave it cleared to apply the time span globally to line graphs on all dashboards.

Settings specified on the Dashboard Configuration dialog box are applied only to the current user's session.

## Managing custom dashboards

PEM displays performance statistics through a number of system-defined dashboards. Each dashboard contains a series of summary views that contain charts, graphs, and tables that display statistics related to the selected object. You can use the **Manage Dashboards** tab to create and manage custom dashboards that display the information that's most relevant to your system.

To create a custom dashboard, select **Create New Dashboard** located in the Quick Links section of the **Manage Dashboards** tab.

To modify an existing dashboard, select **Edit** next to the dashboard name. The dashboard editor opens, displaying the definition of the dashboard. After you finish modifying the dashboard's definition, select **Save**.

To delete a dashboard, select **Delete** next to the dashboard name.

### Creating a custom dashboard

You can use the PEM dashboard editor to create or modify a custom dashboard. The custom dashboard can include predefined charts, custom charts, or a mix of predefined and custom charts.

Use the **Configure** section to specify general information about the dashboard:

-   Specify a name for the dashboard in the **Name** field. 
-   Use the **Level** list to specify the level of the PEM hierarchy in the PEM client on which to display the dashboard. You can access a dashboard using the **Dashboards** menu on a global level, an agent level, the server level, or the database level. Each selected level in the list exposes a different set of metrics on which to base the custom dashboard's charts.
-   Provide a description of the dashboard in the **Description** field.

Provide information in the **Ops dashboard options** box to use the dashboard as an Ops dashboard:

-   Set **Ops Dashboard?** to **Yes** to create a dashboard that's formatted to display on an Ops monitor.
-   Set **Show Title?** to **Yes** to display the dashboard name at the top of the Ops dashboard.
-   Use the **Font** list to select a custom font style for the title. 
-   Use the **Font size** list to select a custom font size for the title. 

Use the **Permissions** box to specify the users who can view the new dashboard:

-   Set **Share with all** to **Yes** to allow all teams to access the dashboard. Set it to **No** to enable the **Access permissions** field.
-   Use the **Access permissions** field to specify the roles that can view the new dashboard. In the field, select from the list of users to add a role to the list of users with dashboard access.

After you complete the **Configure Dashboard** section, select the arrow in the upper-right corner to close the section and access the **Dashboard Layout Design** section.

Select **Edit** in a section header to specify a section name. Then, select the plus sign (+) to add a chart to the section.

Use the arrows to the right of each chart category to display the charts available and select a chart.

Use the chart detail selectors to specify placement details for the chart:

-   Use the **Chart width** selector to indicate the width of the chart. Select **50%** to display the chart in half of the dashboard or **100%** to use the whole dashboard width.

-   Use the **Chart alignment** selector to indicate the position of the chart in the section, left, center, or right justified.

Tables are always displayed centered.

When creating or editing a custom dashboard, you can drag to rearrange the charts in a section or to move a chart to a different section.

To add another chart to your dashboard, select the plus sign (+) in the section header. After you finish editing the dashboard, select **Save**.

### Creating an Ops dashboard

You can use the PEM dashboard editor to create a custom dashboard formatted for display on an Ops monitor. An Ops dashboard displays the specified charts and graphs while omitting header information and minimizing extra banners, titles, and borders.

To create an Ops dashboard, provide detailed information about the Ops display in the **Ops dashboard options** section of the Create Dashboard dialog box.

-   Set **Ops Dashboard?** to **Yes** to create a dashboard that's formatted for display on an Ops monitor.
-   Set **Show Title?** to **Yes** to display the dashboard name at the top of the Ops dashboard.
-   Use the **Font** list to select a custom font style for the title. 
-   Use the **Font size** list to select a custom font size for the title. 

After adding charts and tables to the Ops dashboard, select **Save**. You can then access the dashboard by navigating through the **Dashboards** menu of the hierarchy level specified in the **Level** field on the New Dashboard dialog box.
