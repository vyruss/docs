The PEM Agent that's installed with the PEM server can monitor multiple servers that reside on the same host or on remote hosts. The PEM functionality on servers monitored by a remote agent might be limited. For detailed information about remote monitoring functionality see the [PEM agent privileges](/pem/latest/pem_online_help/02_toc_pem_agent/05_pem_agent_privileges/).

For detailed information about installing a standalone PEM agent on monitored hosts, see:

-   [Installing on Linux](installing_on_linux)
-   [Installing on Windows](installing_pem_agent_on_windows)

For detailed information about registering, managing, and troubleshooting the agent, see:

-   [Managing a PEM agent](../managing_pem_agent/) 
-   [Troubleshooting for PEM agent](../troubleshooting_agent/)
