After installing a PEM server and agent, you can configure PEM to start monitoring and managing PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server instances. The PEM server installer installs the PEM web interface. You can use the interface to review information about objects that reside on monitored servers or to review statistical information gathered by the PEM server.

After the server installation completes, you can open the PEM interface in your choice of browser by navigating to:

`https://<ip_address_of_PEM_host>:8443/pem`

`ip_address_of_PEM_host` specifies the IP address of the host of the PEM server. 

Use the fields on the Postgres Enterprise Manager Login window to authenticate yourself with the PEM server:

-   Provide the name of a `pem` database user in the **Username** field. For the first user connecting, this is the name provided when installing the PEM server.

-   Provide the password associated with the user in the **Password** field.

After providing your credentials, select **Login** to connect to PEM.

The PEM web interface opens, displaying the Global Overview dashboard.

The Browser pane displays a tree that provides access to information about the database objects that reside on each server. The tree expands to display a hierarchical view of the servers and objects that the PEM server monitors.

Before you can use the PEM web interface to manage or monitor a database server, you must register that server with the PEM server. When you register a server, you describe the connection to the server, provide authentication information for the connection, and specify any management preferences (optionally binding an agent).

A server can be managed or unmanaged:

-   A *managed* server is bound to a PEM agent. The PEM agent monitors the server to which it's bound and performs tasks or reports statistics for display on the PEM dashboards. A managed server has access to extended PEM functionality such as custom alerting. When registering a server, you can also allow PEM to restart a managed server as required.
-   An *unmanaged* server isn't bound to a PEM agent. You can create database objects on an unmanaged server, but extended PEM functionality (such as custom alerting) isn't supported on an unmanaged server.

You must also ensure the `pg_hba.conf` file of the server that you're registering allows connections from the host of the PEM web interface.

To access online help for the PEM web interface, select **Help** from the menu bar. The online help content is also available from the [EDB website](pem_online_help/).

## The PEM menu bar

The PEM menu bar provides access to commands and features that you can use to manage your database servers and the objects that reside on those servers. If an option is disabled:

-   The database server to which you are currently connected might not support the selected feature.

-   The selected menu option might not apply to the current object.

-   The role that you used to connect to the server might not have enough privileges to change the selected object.

Context-sensitive menus across the top of the PEM web interface allow you to customize your environment and provide access to the enterprise management features of PEM.
