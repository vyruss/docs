Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) is designed to assist database administrators, system architects, and performance analysts when administering, monitoring, and tuning PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server database servers. PEM was designed to manage and monitor a single server or multiple servers from a single console, allowing complete control over monitored databases.

The SQL Profiler Plugin works with PEM to allow you to profile a server's workload. You can install the SQL Profiler plugin on servers with or without a PEM Agent. However you can run traces only in ad hoc mode on unmanaged servers, and you can schedule them only on managed servers.

SQL Profiler is officially supported only on the EDB distributions of PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server supported versions. The plugin is distributed using StackBuilder or as operating system-dependent packages in EDB's yum repositories. The plugin is also distributed and installed with the EDB Postgres Advanced Server installations.
