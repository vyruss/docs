The process of uninstalling SQL Profiler is platform specific.

## Uninstalling SQL Profiler from Windows hosts

If you're using SQL Profiler on a Windows host, Windows locks any files that were executed or loaded into memory. To release any locked files, you must stop the Postgres server before performing an uninstall.

To stop the service: 

1.  In the Control Panel select **System and Security > Administrative Tools**. 
1.  Double-click **Services** icon. 
1.  In the Services dialog box, select the service name in the list, and use the option provided on the dialog box to stop the service.

After stopping the Postgres server, delete the existing SQL Profiler query set on each node by invoking the `uninstall-sql-profiler.sql` script. By default, the script resides in the `share\contrib` directory under your EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL installation.

## Uninstalling SQL Profiler from CentOS or RHEL hosts

To uninstall a SQL Profiler installation that resides on a Linux host, delete the existing SQL Profiler query set on each node by invoking the `uninstall-sql-profiler.sql` script.

By default, if you're using EDB Postgres Advanced Server on a Linux host, the script resides in the `share/contrib` directory under the EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation. If you're using a PostgreSQL installation on a Linux host, the script resides in the `share/contrib` directory under the PostgreSQL installation.
