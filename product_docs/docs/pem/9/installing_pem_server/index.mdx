The two primary deployment options for Postgres Enterprise Manager are a standalone server or a high-availability environment.

To deploy a standalone server, see:
-   [Installing on Linux](pem_server_inst_linux)
-   [Installing on Windows](pem_server_inst_windows)

To deploy a high availability environment, see [Using Failover Manager for high availability](../considerations/setup_ha_using_efm).

For either of the options, you can deploy connection pooling. For more details, see [Connection pooling using pgBouncer](../considerations/pem_pgbouncer).
