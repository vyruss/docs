The DDL statement is executed in a controlled manner such that the target table is exclusively locked (by the default setting of configuration option `ddlChangeTableLock`) during the course of the operation. This is done to avoid loss of any transactions while the replication triggers and shadow table are modified by the DDL change replication process. Only one target table is locked at a time while DDL change replication takes place on that table, its triggers, and shadow table.

If there's a backlog of pending transactions, we recommend that you perform an explicit synchronization replication before performing DDL change replication. This approach avoids prolonging the DDL change replication process.

Perform DDL change replication when the OLTP rate is very low (near zero).

!!! Note
    You can turn off exclusive acquisition of each target table during the DDL change replication process by setting `ddlChangeTableLock` to `false`. However, make this change only when there are no write transactions taking place against the target table. Otherwise, transactions might not be recorded by the replication system. See [DDL change replication table locking](../../10_appendix/04_miscellaneous_xdb_processing_topics/01_publications_and_subscriptions_server_conf_options/11_ddl_change_replication_table_locking/#ddl_change_replication_table_locking) for more information on the `ddlChangeTableLock` configuration option.

The following is the series of steps that occur during the DDL change replication process.

-   The publication server performs a health check across all databases in the replication system to ensure you can access them. If any database is not available, the DDL change replication process stops and notifies you.
-   If the publication server configuration option `ddlChangeTableLock` is set to its default value of `true`, an exclusive table lock is requested on the table to which the DDL change is to be applied. If another application already has a lock on the table, there's a wait time of two minutes. After that the DDL change replication process stops if the lock isn't released before then. If `ddlChangeTableLock` is set to `false`, an exclusive table lock isn't requested.
-   The DDL statement is executed against the target table. The replication triggers and shadow table are modified accordingly. If an error occurs, you're notified and the operation stops. If `ddlChangeTableLock` is set to `true`, the exclusive lock is released.
-   These two actions are repeated on the target table for each database in the replication system.
-   The in-memory table metadata definition is refreshed to reflect the DDL change. You're notified when the operation completes successfully.
-   If an error occurs during these steps, any changes up to that point are rolled back so that the publication table, replication triggers, and shadow table revert to their original state prior to the start of this operation. If one or more databases goes down before the operation finishes, the publication is marked as dirty to avoid further replication events.

!!! Note
   When you execute the alterDDL command, non-MDN nodes shouldn't have any CDC changes during that window for MMR setup. If there are any CDC changes, it may result in data loss and a break in replication.

!!! Note
   The replicateDDL command performs an implicit synchronization operation that replicates any backlog changes before applying the DDL changes. When continuous data becomes available for replication, this operation may take a long time to complete.
