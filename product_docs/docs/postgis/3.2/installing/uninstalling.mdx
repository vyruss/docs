This section walks you through the process of uninstalling PostGIS.

## Uninstalling PostGIS on a CentOS/RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux host

To uninstall PostGIS on a CentOS/RHEL host, assume the identity of the root user and invoke the following command:

On CentOS/RHEL 7 for EPAS version 13:

```shell
yum -y erase edb-as13-postgis3*
```

On CentOS/RHEL 7 for older versions of EPAS:

```shell
yum erase edb-as<xx>-postgis-*<y.y.y>
```

Where *&lt;xx>* is the Advanced Server version and &lt;y.y.y> is the PostGIS version you want to uninstall.

On Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux/RHEL 8 for EPAS version 13:

```shell
dnf -y erase edb-as13-postgis3*
```

On Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux/RHEL 8 for older versions of EPAS:

```shell
dnf erase edb-as<xx>-postgis-*<y.y.y>
```

## Uninstalling PostGIS on a Debian/Ubuntu host

To uninstall PostGIS on a Debian or Ubuntu host, invoke the following command:

```shell
apt-get remove edb-as<xx>-postgis-<y.y>*
```

Where *&lt;xx>* is the Advanced Server version and &lt;y.y> is the PostGIS version you want to uninstall

## Uninstalling PostGIS on a SLES host

To uninstall PostGIS on a SLES host, assume the identity of the root user and invoke the following command:

```shell
zypper remove edb-as12-postgis*
```

## Uninstalling PostGIS on a Windows host

The PostGIS graphical installer creates an uninstaller that you can use to remove PostGIS. The uninstaller is created in the installation directory that you have specified while installing PostGIS (default is `C:\Program Files\edb\as13`).

1.  Navigate into the directory that contains the uninstaller and assume superuser privileges. Open the uninstaller and click `Yes` to begin uninstalling PostGIS:
