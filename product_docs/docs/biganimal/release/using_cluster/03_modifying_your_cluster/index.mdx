You can modify your cluster by modifying:

-   Cluster name and password
-   Instance type
-   Volume properties
-   Networking type
-   Database configuration parameters
-   High availability

You can also modify your cluster by installing Postgres extensions. See [Postgres extensions](/biganimal/release/using_cluster/03_modifying_your_cluster/extensions) for more information.

!!! Note
    You can't switch from a single node cluster or a high availability cluster to an extreme high availability cluster or vice versa.

## Modify your cluster

1.  Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com) portal.

2.  From the [**Clusters**](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page, select the name of the cluster you want to edit.

3.  Select **Edit Cluster** from the top right corner of the **Cluster Info** panel.

4.  You can modify the following settings on the corresponding tab of the Edit Cluster page:

 | Volume type                                          | Cluster Settings | You cannot switch between the io2 and io2 Block Express volume types in an AWS cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
 | Volume properties                                    | Cluster Settings | It can take up to six hours to tune IOPS or resize the disks of your cluster because AWS requires a cool down period after volume modifications as explained in the [Limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/modify-volume-requirements.html) section. The volume properties are disabled and cannot be modified while this is in progress. |
 | Networking type (public or private)                  | Cluster Settings | If you are using Azure and previously setup a private link and want to  change to a public network, you must remove the private link resources  before making the change.                                                                                                        |

5.  Save your changes.
 !!! Note
     Saving changes might require a database restart.
