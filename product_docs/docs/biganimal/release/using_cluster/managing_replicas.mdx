### Create a faraway replica

You can create faraway replicas in different regions in your cloud. There is no limit on the number of faraway replicas each cluster can have. However, the added resources and data transfers can increase your cloud costs.

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page. A list of previously created clusters appears.

1. Select the **Faraway Replica** icon next to a cluster to create its faraway replica. The Create Replica page appears.

1. You can't edit the **Cloud Provider** field. The cloud provider is inherited from the parent cluster. 

1. In the **Replica Settings** tab, Enter a name for your replica in the **Faraway Replica Name** field.

1. Enter a password for your replica in the **Password** field.
 
 You can't edit the **Database Type** field. The Postgres type and Postgres version are inherited from the parent cluster.  

1. In the **Region** section, select the region where you want to deploy your replica.

 You can select a region for deploying your replica even if it is not yet *Active*. Your replica creation request is added to a queue, and the replica is created after you activate the region. See [Activating regions](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/activating_regions) for more information.
 
1.  The fields in the **Instance Type** section are populated with values inherited from the parent cluster. You can edit these fields. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) for details on instance type settings.

1.  The fields in the **Storage** section are populated with values inherited from the parent cluster. You can edit these fields. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) for details on the storage settings.
 
1.  In the **Networking** section, specify whether to use private or public networking. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) for details on the Networking settings.

1. In the **Backups** section, Change the default replica backup retention period of 30 days using the **Retention Time** controls. You can configure the retention period as follows:

- 1 - 180 days
- 1 - 25 weeks
- 1 - 6 months

1. Select **Create Replica**. 


### Promote a faraway replica

You can promote a faraway replica to a full-fledged cluster, which makes it capable of accepting writes. The new cluster created is different from the parent cluster, and it doesn't replace the parent cluster.

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page. A list of previously created clusters appears.

1. Select the cluster with the replica you want to promote. In the **Overview** tab, you can see the cluster's replicas under **Faraway Replicas**.

1. Select the **Promote replica** icon next to the replica you want to promote. The Create Cluster page appears. 

1. The cluster settings are populated with values inherited from the parent cluster. You can edit the cluster settings while creating your cluster. 

   !!! NoteNotes
     - You can promote a faraway replica to a single node or high availability cluster but not to an extreme high availability cluster. 
     - While promoting a replica to a cluster, you can't modify the **Cloud Provider**, **Postgres Type**, **Postgres Version**, and **Region** fields.
   !!!

1. Select **Promote Replica**. 


### Modify a faraway replica

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal portal](https://portal.biganimal.com/).

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page. A list of previously created clusters appears.

1. Select the cluster with the replica you want to modify. In the **Overview** tab, you can see the cluster's replicas under **Faraway Replicas**.

1. Select the **Edit replica** icon next to the replica you want to modify. The Edit Replica page appears. 

1. In the **Replica Settings** tab, in the **Faraway Replica Name** field, enter the name for your replica.

1. In the **Password** field, enter a password for your replica. 
 
 In the **Database Type** section, you can see the Postgres type and Postgres version inherited from the parent cluster. You can't edit the Postgres type and Postgres version. 

1.  In the **Region** section, select the region where you want to deploy your replica.

 You can select a region for deploying your replica even if it is not yet *Active*. Your cluster creation request is added to a queue, and the replica is created after you activate the region. See [Activating regions](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/activating_regions) for more information.
 
1.  The fields in the **Instance Type** section are populated with values inherited from the parent cluster. You can edit the fields in the **Instance Type** section. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) for details on the instance type settings. 

 !!! Note
     To avoid lag during replication, ensure that your replicas' instance type is at least as large as the parent cluster's instance type.

1.  The fields in the **Storage** section are populated with values inherited from the parent cluster. You can edit the fields in the **Storage** section. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) for details on the storage settings.

 !!! Note
     To avoid lag during replication, ensure that your replicas' storage type is at least as large as the parent cluster's storage type.
 
1.  In the **Networking** section, you specify whether to use private or public networking. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) for details on the Networking settings.

1. Select **Save**. 

### Restore a replica backup

You can restore a replica backup to a standalone cluster. A new stand alone cluster is created and initialized with data from the replica backup.

1.  Select the cluster you want to restore on the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page in the [BigAnimal portal](https://portal.biganimal.com). 

1. Select the cluster with the replica you want to restore. In the **Overview** tab, you can see the cluster's replicas under **Faraway Replicas**.

1.  From **Quick Actions**, select **Restore Replica**.

1.  On the Restore Replica page: 
    1.  Fill in the required fields.
    1.  In the **Source** section, in the **Point in Time Restore** field, select **Now** on the calendar to restore to the last possible recovery point. Or, choose a timestamp to restore further back in time. 
    3.  Review your selections and select **Restore Replica** to begin the restore process.  
4.  The new stand alone cluster is now available on the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page.


### Delete a faraway replica

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal portal](https://portal.biganimal.com/).

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page. A list of previously created clusters appears.

1. Select the cluster with the replica you want to promote. In the **Overview** tab, you can see the cluster's replicas under **Faraway Replicas**. 

1. Select the **Delete replica** icon next to the replica you want to modify. The replica is deleted.
