### Create a faraway replica

You can create faraway replicas in different regions in your cloud. There is no limit on the number of faraway replicas each cluster can have. However, the added resources and data transfers can increase your cloud costs.

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com/) portal.

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page. A list of previously created clusters appears.

1. Select the *Faraway Replica* icon next to a cluster to create its faraway replica. The Create Replica page appears.

1. You cannot edit the **Cloud Provider** field. The cloud provider is inherited from the parent cluster. 

1. In the Replica Settings tab, Enter a name for your replica in the **Faraway Replica Name** field.

1. Enter a password for your replica in the **Password** field.

1. You cannot edit the **Database Type** field. The Postgres type and Postgres version are inherited from the parent cluster.  

1. In the **Region** section, select the region where you want to deploy your replica.

 You can select a region for deploying your replica even if it is not yet *Active*. Your replica creation request is added to a queue, and the replica is created after you activate the region. See [Activating regions](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/activating_regions) for more information.
 
1.  The fields in the **Instance Type** section are prepopulated with values inherited from the parent cluster and are editable. You can edit these fields. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) for details on instance type settings.

1.  The fields in the **Storage** section are prepopulated with values inherited from the parent cluster. You can edit these fields. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) for details on the storage settings.
 
1.  In the **Networking** section, specify whether to use private or public networking. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) for details on the Networking settings.

1. Select **Create Replica**. 


### Promote a faraway replica

You can promote a faraway replica to a full-fledged cluster making it capable of accepting writes. The new cluster created is different from the parent cluster and it does not replace the parent cluster.

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com/) portal.

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page. A list of previously created clusters appears.

1. Select the cluster with the replica you want to promote.

1. In the **Overview** tab, you can see the cluster's replicas under **Faraway Replicas**.

1. Select the *Promote replica* icon next to the replica you want to promote. The Create Cluster page appears. 

1. The cluster settings are prepopulated with values inherited from the parent cluster. You can edit the cluster settings while creating your cluster. 

   !!! NoteNotes
     - A faraway replica can be promoted to a single node cluster or a high availablility cluster, but not an extreme high availability cluster. 
     - **Cloud Provider**, **Postgres Type**, **Postgres Version**, and **Region** fields cannot be modified while promoting a replica to a cluster.
   !!!

1. Select **Promote Replica**. 
 

### Modify a faraway replica

To avoid lag during replication, do not reduce the capabilities of the replica by selecting settings lower than of the parent cluster.

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com/) portal.

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page. A list of previously created clusters appears.

1. Select the cluster with the replica you want to promote.

1. In the **Overview** tab, you can see the cluster's replicas under **Faraway Replicas**.

1. Select the *Edit replica* icon next to the replica you want to modify. The Edit Replica page appears. 

1. In the Replica Settings tab, Enter the name for your replica in the **Faraway Replica Name** field.

1.  Enter a password for your replica in the **Password** field.

1.  In the **Database Type** section, you can see the Postgres type and Postgres version inherited from the parent cluster. You cannot edit the Postgres type and Postgres version. 

1.  In the **Region** section, select the region where you want to deploy your replica.

 You can select a region for deploying your replica even if it is not yet *Active*. Your cluster creation request is added to a queue, and the replica is created after you activate the region. See [Activating regions](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/activating_regions) for more information.
 
1.  The fields in the **Instance Type** section are prepopulated with values inherited from the parent cluster. You can edit the fields in the **Instance Type** section. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) for details on the instance type settings.

1.  The fields in the **Storage** section are prepopulated with values inherited from the parent cluster. You can edit the fields in the **Storage** section. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) for details on the storage settings.
 
1.  In the **Networking** section, you specify whether to use private or public networking. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) for details on the Networking settings.

### Delete a faraway replica

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com/) portal.

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page. A list of previously created clusters appears.

1. Select the cluster with the replica you want to promote.

1. In the **Overview** tab, you can see the cluster's replicas under **Faraway Replicas**. 

1. Select the *Delete replica* icon next to the replica you want to modify. The replica is deleted.
