title: "Cross-regional replication"
---

You can create faraway (read) replicas across regions and cloud providers in BigAnimal. There is no limit on the number of faraway replicas your cluster can have. Note that these added resources and data transfer can increase your cloud costs. 

## Disaster recovery

Setting up faraway replicas of your cluster across regions and cloud providers can help build a solid disaster recovery (DR) plan. In case of a failure, you can manually promote the faraway replica to a full-fledged cluster making it capable of accepting writes. 
 
!!! Note
    In case of a failure, BigAnimal does not automatically promote faraway replicas to the primary node, unlike standby replicas. 

## Improved read query performance

If the faraway replica is set up in the same region, your application can benefit from an improved read query performance. For example, applications can read from an *us-west* replica the writes made to a cluster in the *us-east* region.

## Log shipping

Clusters in BigAnimal are continuously backed up through Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) archiving. As new data is archived, BigAnimal copies the WAL files from your cloud object storage and applies them to the faraway replicas. 

Log shipping is a synchronous transfer technique that facilitates:
- Hassle-free replication (without requiring additional user authentication)
- Predictable time frames for replication
- Replication across clouds
- Minimal network requirements
