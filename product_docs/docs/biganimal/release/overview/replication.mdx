title: "Faraway replicas"
---

You can create faraway replicas in different regions in your cloud. In case of a failure, you can manually promote the faraway replica to a full-fledged BigAnimal cluster making it capable of accepting writes. 

Faraway replicas are deployed as single node, read-only clusters. There is no limit on the number of faraway replicas each cluster can have. However, the added resources and data transfers can increase your cloud costs. 

**Log shipping**: As new data is archived, BigAnimal copies and transfers the WAL files from your cloud object storage solution and asynchronously transfers them to faraway replicas. Log shipping facilitates:

- No changes to the database tables are required to enable this capability, low administration overhead
- Predictable timelines for replication
- Minimal network requirements

## Advantages

- **Disaster recovery**: Deploying faraway replicas across regions can help you build a solid disaster recovery (DR) plan.

- **Improved read query performance**: If the faraway replica is set up in the same region, your application can benefit from an improved read query performance. For example, applications can read from an *us-west* replica the writes made to a cluster in the *us-east* region.

## Limitations

- Unlike standby replicas, BigAnimal does not automatically promote faraway replicas to the parent cluster. 

- Promoting a faraway replica to a BigAnimal cluster can result in data loss. Replica promotion is optimized for disaster recovery and not consistency.

## Managing faraway replicas

### Create a faraway replica

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com/) portal.

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page. A list of previously created clusters appears.

1. Select the *Faraway Replica* icon next to a cluster to create its faraway. The Create Replica page appears.

1. You cannot edit the **Cloud Provider** field. The cloud provider is inherited from the parent cluster. 

1. In the Replica Settings tab, Enter a name for your replica in the **Faraway Replica Name** field.

1. Enter a password for your replica in the **Password** field.
<!-- Any restriction for password? -->

1. You cannot edit the **Database Type** field. The Postgres type and Postgres version are inherited from the parent cluster.  

1. In the **Region** section, select the region where you want to deploy your replica.

 You can select a region for deploying your replica even if it is not yet *Active*. Your cluster creation request is added to a queue, and the replica is created after you activate the region. See [Activating regions](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/activating_regions) for more information.
 
1.  The fields in the **Instance Type** section are prepopulated with values inherited from the parent cluster and are editable. You can edit these fields. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/) for details on instance type settings.

1.  The fields in the **Storage** section are prepopulated with values inherited from the parent cluster. You can edit these fields. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/) for details on the storage settings.
 
1.  In the **Networking** section, specify whether to use private or public networking. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/) for details on the Networking settings.
<!-- not sure if this section is editable -->

1. Select **Create Replica**. 


### Promote a faraway replica

You can promote the faraway replica to a full-fledged cluster making it capable of accepting writes. Note that the new cluster is different from the parent cluster and it does not replace the parent cluster.

!!! Important
    Because the transfer of data from the read replica to the cluster is asynchronous, promoting a faraway replica to a BigAnimal cluster can result in data loss. Replica promotion is optimized for disaster recovery and not consistency.


1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com/) portal.

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page. A list of previously created clusters appears.


1. Select the cluster with the replica you want to promote.

1. In the **Overview** tab, you can see the cluster's replicas under **Faraway Replicas**.

1. In the cluster's details page, select the **Replication** tab. A list of the replicas of the cluster appears.

1. Select the *Promote* icon next to the replica you want to promote. The Create Cluster page appears. 

1. The cluster settings are prepopulated with values inherited from the parent cluster. You can edit the cluster settings while creating your cluster. 

1. Select the settings for you cluster under the **Cluster Type**, **Cloud Provider**, **Cluster Name**, **Password**, **Database Type**, **Region**, **Instance Type**, **Storage**, **Networking**, and **DB Configuration Parameters** fields. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/) for details on the settings you can set for your cluster settings.

 !!! Note
     A faraway replica can be promoted to a single node cluster or a high availablility cluster, but not an extreme high availability cluster. 

1. Select **Promote Replica**. 
 

### Modify a faraway replica

To avoid lag during replication, do not reduce the capabilities of the replica by selecting settings lower than  of the parent cluster.

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com/) portal.

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page. A list of previously created clusters appears.

1. Select the cluster with the replica you want to promote.

1. In the **Overview** tab, you can see the cluster's replicas under **Faraway Replicas**.

1. Select the *Edit* icon next to the replica you want to modify. The Edit Replica page appears. 

1. In the Replica Settings tab, Enter the name for your replica in the **Faraway Replica Name** field.

1.  Enter a password for your replica in the **Password** field.

1.  In the **Database Type** section, you can see the Postgres type and Postgres version inherited from the parent cluster. You cannot edit the Postgres type and Postgres version. 

1.  In the **Region** section, select the region where you want to deploy your replica.

 You can select a region for deploying your replica even if it is not yet *Active*. Your cluster creation request is added to a queue, and the replica is created after you activate the region. See [Activating regions](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/activating_regions) for more information.
 
1.  The fields in the **Instance Type** section are prepopulated with values inherited from the parent cluster. You can edit the fields in the **Instance Type** section. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/) for details on the instance type settings.

1.  The fields in the **Storage** section are prepopulated with values inherited from the parent cluster. You can edit the fields in the **Storage** section. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/) for details on the storage settings.
 
1.  In the **Networking** section, you specify whether to use private or public networking. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/) for details on the Networking settings.

1. Select **Save**. 

### Delete a faraway replica

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com/) portal.

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page. A list of previously created clusters appears.

1. Select the cluster with the replica you want to promote.

1. In the **Overview** tab, you can see the cluster's replicas under **Faraway Replicas**. 

1. Select the *Delete* icon next to the replica you want to modify. The replica is deleted.
