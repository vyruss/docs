<!-- What is the terminology used for farway replicas -->

You can maintain faraway replicas of your cluster in different cloud regions. As new archive data is written to your cluster's backup, BigAnimal copies the data to the faraway replicas.

<!-- Are we supporting regions across clouds? -->

!!! Note
    Unlike standby replicas, BigAnimal does not automatically promote faraway replicas to the primary node.

## Advantages of faraway clusters

- Setting up replicas of your cluster can significantly reduce downtime and help build a more solid disaster recovery (DR) plan. In case of a failure, you can manually promote the faraway replica to a BigAnimal cluster making it capable of accepting writes.

- If the faraway replica is set up in the same region, your application can benefit from an improved read query performance. For example, applications can read from an *us-west* replica the writes made to a cluster in the *us-east* region.
