title: "Faraway replicas"
---

You can create faraway (read) replicas of your single node and high availability clusters in different regions of your cloud. In case of a failure, you can manually promote the faraway replica to a full-fledged BigAnimal cluster making it capable of accepting writes. See [Managing replicas](/biganimal/release/using_cluster/managing_replicas).

## Advantages

- **Disaster recovery** — You can create faraway replicas in different regions in your cloud. Deploying faraway replicas across regions can help you build a more solid disaster recovery (DR) plan.

- **Improved read query performance** — For an improved read query performance, set up the faraway replica in the same region as your application. For example, applications can read the writes made to a cluster in the `us-east` region from a `us-west` replica. 

## Limitations

- **Manual intervention** — Unlike standby replicas, BigAnimal doesn't automatically promote faraway replicas to the parent cluster in case of a failure. 
    
- **Replication lag** — Promoting a faraway replica to a BigAnimal cluster can result in loss of data. See [Log shipping](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/04_backup_and_restore/#faraway-replicas).

## Example
