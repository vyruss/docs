title: "Faraway replicas"
---

You can create faraway (read) replicas across regions and cloud providers in BigAnimal. There is no limit on the number of faraway replicas your cluster can have. However, the added resources and data transfers can increase your cloud costs. 

Faraway replicas are deployed as single node clusters.

## Advantages of faraway replicas

### Disaster recovery

Deploying faraway replicas across regions and cloud providers can help you build a solid disaster recovery (DR) plan. 

### Improved read query performance

If the faraway replica is set up in the same region, your application can benefit from an improved read query performance. For example, applications can read from an *us-west* replica the writes made to a cluster in the *us-east* region.

## Limitations

- Unlike standby replicas, BigAnimal does not automatically promote faraway replicas to the parent cluster. 

- In case of a failure, you can manually promote the faraway replica to a full-fledged BigAnimal cluster making it capable of accepting writes.
 
 Replica promotion is optimized for disaster recovery, and not data consistency. Because the replication is asynchronous, promoting a faraway replica to a BigAnimal cluster can result in some data loss.

- Creating replicas across cloud service providers will involve transferrring your data through the internet.

## Log shipping

Clusters in BigAnimal are continuously backed up through Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) archiving. As new data is archived, BigAnimal copies the WAL files from your cloud object storage and applies them to the faraway replicas. 

Log shipping is a asynchronous transfer technique that facilitates:
- Hassle-free replication (without additional user authentication between clusters)
- Predictable timelines for replication
- Replication across cloud providers
- Minimal network requirements

## Managing faraway replicas

### Create a faraway replica

!!! Important
     To avoid lag during replication, we recommend that you do not reduce the capabilities of the replica by selecting settings lower than those from the parent cluster.

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com/) portal.

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page. A list of previously created clusters appears.

1. Select the *Faraway Replica* icon next to a cluster to create its faraway. The Create Replica page appears.

1. Select the cloud provider for your replica. If you're using your own account and haven't connected it to BigAnimal yet, see [Connecting to your cloud](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/02_connecting_to_your_cloud).

1. In the Replica Settings tab, Enter the name for your replica in the **Faraway Replica Name** field.

1.  Enter a password for your replica in the **Password** field.

1.  In the **Database Type** section, you can see the Postgres type and Postgres version inherited from the parent cluster. You cannot edit the Postgres type and Postgres version. 

1.  In the **Region** section, select the region where you want to deploy your replica.

 You can select a region for deploying your replica even if it is not yet *Active*. Your cluster creation request is added to a queue, and the replica is created after you activate the region. See [Activating regions](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/activating_regions) for more information.
 
1.  The fields in the **Instance Type** section are prepopulated with values inherited from the parent cluster. You can edit the fields in the **Instance Type** section. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/) for details on the instance type settings.

1.  The fields in the **Storage** section are prepopulated with values inherited from the parent cluster. You can edit the fields in the **Storage** section. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/) for details on the storage settings.
 
1.  In the **Networking** section, you specify whether to use private or public networking. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/) for details on the Networking settings.

1. Select **Create Replica**. 


### Promote a faraway replica

You can promote the faraway replica to a full-fledged cluster making it capable of accepting writes. Note that the new cluster created is different from the parent cluster and it does not replace the parent cluster.

!!! Important
    Replica promotion is optimized for disaster recovery, not consistency. Because the replication is asynchronous, promoting a faraway replica to a BigAnimal cluster can result in data loss.


1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com/) portal.

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page. A list of previously created clusters appears.

1. Select the cluster with the replica you want to promote.

1. In the cluster's details page, select the **Replication** tab. A list of replicas of the cluster appears.

1. Select the *Promote* icon next to the replica you want to promote. The Create Cluster page appears. 

1. The cluster settings are prepopulated with values inherited from the parent cluster. You can edit the cluster settings while creating your cluster. 

1. Select the settings for you cluster under the **Cluster Type**, **Cloud Provider**, **Cluster Name**, **Password**, **Database Type**, **Region**, **Instance Type**, **Storage**, **Networking**, and **DB Configuration Parameters** fields. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/) for details on the settings you can set for your cluster settings.

 !!! Note
     A faraway replica can be promoted to a single node cluster or a high availablility cluster, but not an extreme high availability cluster. 

1. Select **Promote Replica**. 
 

### Modify a faraway replica

Any changes made to a cluster's settings are not automatically applied to its replicas's settings. To avoid lag during replication, we recommend that you modify each replica by selecting settings equal to or higher than those of the parent cluster.

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com/) portal.

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page. A list of previously created clusters appears.

1. Select the cluster with the replica you want to promote.

1. In the cluster's details page, select the **Replication** tab. A list of replicas of the cluster appears.

1. Select the *Edit* icon next to the replica you want to modify. The Edit Replica page appears. 

1. In the Replica Settings tab, Enter the name for your replica in the **Faraway Replica Name** field.

1.  Enter a password for your replica in the **Password** field.

1.  In the **Database Type** section, you can see the Postgres type and Postgres version inherited from the parent cluster. You cannot edit the Postgres type and Postgres version. 

1.  In the **Region** section, select the region where you want to deploy your replica.

 You can select a region for deploying your replica even if it is not yet *Active*. Your cluster creation request is added to a queue, and the replica is created after you activate the region. See [Activating regions](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/activating_regions) for more information.
 
1.  The fields in the **Instance Type** section are prepopulated with values inherited from the parent cluster. You can edit the fields in the **Instance Type** section. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/) for details on the instance type settings.

1.  The fields in the **Storage** section are prepopulated with values inherited from the parent cluster. You can edit the fields in the **Storage** section. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/) for details on the storage settings.
 
1.  In the **Networking** section, you specify whether to use private or public networking. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/) for details on the Networking settings.

1. Select **Save**. 

### Delete a faraway replica

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com/) portal.

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page. A list of previously created clusters appears.

1. Select the cluster with the replica you want to promote.

1. In the cluster's details page, select the **Replication** tab. A list of replicas of the cluster appears.

1. Select the *Delete* icon next to the replica you want to modify. The replica is deleted.
