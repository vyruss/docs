title: "Faraway replicas"
---

You can create (faraway read) replicas of your *single node* and *high availability* clusters. In case of a failure, you can manually promote the faraway replica to a full-fledged BigAnimal cluster making it capable of accepting writes. 

**Advantages**

- **Disaster recovery**: You can create faraway replicas in different regions in your cloud.Deploying faraway replicas across regions can help you build a more solid disaster recovery (DR) plan.

- **Improved read query performance**: If the faraway replica is set up in the same region, your application can benefit from an improved read query performance. For example, applications can read from an *us-west* replica the writes made to a cluster in the *us-east* region. 

**Limitations**

- **Manual intervention**: Unlike standby replicas, BigAnimal does not automatically promote faraway replicas to the parent cluster in case of a failure. 
    
- **Replication lag**: Promoting a faraway replica to a BigAnimal cluster can result in loss of data. See [Log shipping](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/04_backup_and_restore/#log-shipping)
