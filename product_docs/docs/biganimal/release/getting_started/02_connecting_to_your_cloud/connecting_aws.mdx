navTitle: AWS

## Prerequisites

Before connecting your cloud, ensure that you are assigned the following AWS managed policies (or an equivalent custom policy granting full access to resources):

- arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/IAMFullAccess

- arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ServiceQuotasFullAccess

## To connect your cloud

Perform the following steps:

1. Open the [AWS Cloud Shell](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell) in your browser.

1.  Create a BigAnimal CLI credential:

   ```shell
   ./biganimal create-credential --name <cred> --address portal.biganimal.com --port 443
   ```

1. Run the `setup-csp` command to set up your cloud provider:

   ```shell
   ./biganimal setup-csp 
   ```
   The command checks for cloud account readiness and displays the results. 

1. If the following readiness checks are not met for your cloud service provider, see [Configure your AWS account](/biganimal/release/getting_started/preparing_cloud_account/02_preparing_aws/#configure-your-aws-account) to manually configure your cloud:

   - Is the AWS CLI configured to access your AWS account?

   - Is the limit on the number of vCPUs and Network Load Balancers (NLBs) in your region sufficient for your clusters?

1. If the cloud readiness checks pass, your cloud account is successfully set up. Connect your cloud account to BigAnimal with following command.
   ```shell
   ./biganimal connect-csp --provider aws
   ```
 Once your cloud account is successfully connected to BigAnimal, you, and other users with the correct permissions, can create clusters.
