!!! note
    The BigAnimal CLI commands used in the procedures for connecting your cloud to BigAnimal registers an application with Azure AD and creates a service principal to delegate Identity and Access Management functions to Azure Active Directory (AD). For more information, see for [Azure EDB cloud utilities](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-utilities/tree/main/azure) in GitHub.

## Prerequisites
Before connecting to your cloud, ensure that you are assigned either the Global Administrator role or the Privileged Role Administrator role in Azure AD.

## To connect your cloud
Perform the following steps:

1. Open the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) in your browser.

1.  Create a BigAnimal CLI credential:

   ```shell
   ./biganimal create-credential --name <cred> --address portal.biganimal.com --port 443
   ```

1. Run the `setup-csp` command to set up your cloud provider:

    ```shell
    ./biganimal setup-csp 
    ```
  The command checks for cloud account readiness and displays the results. 

1. If the following readiness checks are not met, see [Configure your Azure subscription](/biganimal/release/getting_started/preparing_cloud_account/01_preparing_azure#configure-your-azure-subscription) to manually configure your cloud:
       - Are the necessary Azure resource providers registered for your subscription? 

       - Is there a restriction on SKUs for the standard Esv3 family and standard D2_v4 VM size?
       - Is the limit on the number of vCPU and public IP addresses in your region sufficient for your clusters?

1. If the cloud readiness checks pass, your cloud account is successfully set up. Connect your cloud account to BigAnimal with following command.
   ```shell
   ./biganimal connect-csp --provider  azure
   ```
 Once your cloud account is successfully connected to BigAnimal, you, and other users with the correct permissions, can create clusters.
