After resolving errors in your schemas, you can migrate the schemas to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server cluster (for example, instance).

The Migration Portal provides guided steps for migrating your schemas using one of the following target database options:

-   Offline migration - download a data definition language (DDL) SQL file to create the schema manually in a target EDB Postgres Advanced Server database using a client application such as the psql client, pgAdmin, or Toad Edge. This option is suitable for both both on-premises and cloud based migrations.
-   Online migration - connect directly to a target EDB Postgres Advanced Server database and automatically create the schema in it. Generally, this option is most suitable for migrations to databases running in the cloud (either BigAnimal clusters or self-managed instances).

## Offline migration

Migrate schemas manually to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server on Windows or Linux platforms by running a DDL SQL file using a client.

1. Select **Offline Migration**.

1. Select one or more schemas to migrate to EDB Postgres Advanced Server. You can also expand a schema and select specific object types under each schema.
 
 ![Schema and objects are selected](../images/schema_object_selection.png)

 !!! Note
     If your schemas aren't 100% compatible, a banner appears. Complete the Contact Us form as needed.

1. Select **Download SQL file**, to download the assessed schema. The zip package consists of SQL files with DDLs for your selected schemas and objects. The DDLs are grouped in SQL files by project, schemas, or objects.

 | File name                              | Description                                                                              | Example                                                                         |
 |------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | *&lt;ProjectName>* _ALL_OBJECTS.sql            | A single consolidated file consisting of DDLs for all your selected schemas and objects. | **AllTestMigration_ALL_OBJECTS.sql** will consist of DDLs for all objects of schemas OE, SH, IX, and PM, and only selected objects of schema HR.                                                                            |
 | *&lt;SchemaName>* .sql                         | One or more files, each consisting of DDLs for selected objects in a particular schema.  | **HR.sql**  will consist of DDLs for all the selected objects of the HR schema. |
 | *&lt;SchemaName>* &#95; *&lt;ObjectType>* .sql | One or more files, each consisting of DDLs for a single selected object.                 | **HR_TABLE.sql**  will consist of DDLs only for TABLE object of the HR schema. |

1. Import the schema into your target database:

   1. Use the edb psql command line utility to connect to the EDB Postgres Advanced Server database from where the converted schema is to be migrated. 

   1. Create a new database:

      ```SQL
      CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;
      ```

   1. Connect to the new database using the following psql command:

      ```SQL
      \connect <database_name>
      ```

   1. Import the required SQL files into the new database using the following psql command:

      ```SQL
      \i <path_to_exported_schema_file>.sql
      ```

     !!! Note
     You can alternatively use the `pgAdmin` client for the import.1. Import the schema into your target database:

The converted schemas migrate to the target server.

## Online migration

Directly connect to and create schemas in the target EDB Postgres Advanced Server database.

1. Select **Online Migration**.

1. Select one or more schemas to migrate to EDB Postgres Advanced Server. You can also expand a schema and select specific object types under each schema.

1. Enter the required connection details on the `Connect` page.

    ![Connecting to the cloud cluster](../images/mp_migrate_cloud_connection_updated.png)

1. To verify the connection details, select **Test Connection**.

    !!! Note
    You can select **Edit Connection** to make changes to the connection details and retest the connection details.

1. Once the connection is successful, select **Next**.

The converted schemas migrate to the target server.
