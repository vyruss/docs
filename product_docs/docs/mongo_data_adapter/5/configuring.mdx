Before using the MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper:

 1.  Use the [CREATE EXTENSION](#create-extension) command to create the MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper extension on the Postgres host.
 2.  Use the [CREATE SERVER](#create-server) command to define a connection to the MongoDB server.
 3.  Use the [CREATE USER MAPPING](#create-user-mapping) command to define a mapping that associates a Postgres role with the server.
 4.  Use the [CREATE FOREIGN TABLE](#create-foreign-table) command to define a table in the Postgres database that corresponds to a database that resides on the MongoDB cluster.

<div id="create_extension" class="registered_link"></div>

## CREATE EXTENSION

Use the `CREATE EXTENSION` command to create the `mongo_fdw` extension. To invoke the command, use your client of choice (for example, psql) to connect to the Postgres database from which you want to query the MongoDB server, and invoke the command:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION [IF NOT EXISTS] mongo_fdw [WITH] [SCHEMA schema_name];
```

### Parameters

`IF NOT EXISTS`

 Include the `IF NOT EXISTS` clause to instruct the server to issue a notice instead of returning an error if an extension with the same name already exists.

`schema_name`

 Optionally specify the name of the schema in which to install the extension's objects.

### Example

The following command installs the MongoDB foreign data wrapper:

 `CREATE EXTENSION mongo_fdw;`

For more information about using the foreign data wrapper `CREATE EXTENSION` command, see the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createextension.html).

## CREATE SERVER

Use the `CREATE SERVER` command to define a connection to a foreign server. The syntax is:

```sql
CREATE SERVER server_name FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER mongo_fdw
    [OPTIONS (option 'value' [, ...])]
```

The role that defines the server is the owner of the server. Use the `ALTER SERVER` command to reassign ownership of a foreign server. To create a foreign server, you must have `USAGE` privilege on the foreign-data wrapper specified in the `CREATE SERVER` command.

### Parameters

`server_name`

 Use `server_name` to specify a name for the foreign server. The server name must be unique in the database.

`FOREIGN_DATA_WRAPPER`

 Include the `FOREIGN_DATA_WRAPPER` clause to specify for the server to use the `mongo_fdw` foreign data wrapper when connecting to the cluster.

`OPTIONS`

 Use the `OPTIONS` clause of the `CREATE SERVER` command to specify connection information for the foreign server object. You can include these options.

The table-level value of the option takes precedence over the server-level option value. Default is `true`.| 

### Example

The following command creates a foreign server named `mongo_server` that uses the `mongo_fdw` foreign data wrapper to connect to a host with an IP address of `127.0.0.1`:

```sql
CREATE SERVER mongo_server FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER mongo_fdw OPTIONS (host '127.0.0.1', port '27017');
```

The foreign server uses the default port (`27017`) for the connection to the client on the MongoDB cluster.

For more information about using the `CREATE SERVER` command, see the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createserver.html).

<div id="create_user_mapping" class="registered_link"></div>

## CREATE USER MAPPING

Use the `CREATE USER MAPPING` command to define a mapping that associates a Postgres role with a foreign server:

```sql
CREATE USER MAPPING FOR role_name SERVER server_name
       [OPTIONS (option 'value' [, ...])];
```

You must be the owner of the foreign server to create a user mapping for that server.

### Parameters

`role_name`

 Use `role_name` to specify the role to associate with the foreign server.

`server_name`

 Use `server_name` to specify the name of the server that defines a connection to the MongoDB cluster.

`OPTIONS`

 Use the `OPTIONS` clause to specify connection information for the foreign server.

 `username` is the name of the user on the MongoDB server.

 `password` is the password associated with the username.

### Example

The following command creates a user mapping for a role named `enterprisedb`. The mapping is associated with a server named `mongo_server`.

 `CREATE USER MAPPING FOR enterprisedb SERVER mongo_server;`

If the database host uses secure authentication, provide connection credentials when creating the user mapping:

```sql
CREATE USER MAPPING FOR enterprisedb SERVER mongo_server OPTIONS (username 'mongo_user', password 'mongo_pass');
```

The command creates a user mapping for a role named `enterprisedb` that is associated with a server named `mongo_server`. When connecting to the MongoDB server, the server authenticates as `mongo_user` and provides a password of `mongo_pass`.

For detailed information about the `CREATE USER MAPPING` command, see the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createusermapping.html).

<div id="create_foreign_table" class="registered_link"></div>

## CREATE FOREIGN TABLE

A foreign table is a pointer to a table that resides on the MongoDB host. Before creating a foreign table definition on the Postgres server, connect to the MongoDB server and create a collection. The columns in the table map to columns in a table on the Postgres server. Then, use the `CREATE FOREIGN TABLE` command to define a table on the Postgres server with columns that correspond to the collection that resides on the MongoDB host. The syntax is:

```sql
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] table_name ( [
  { column_name data_type [ OPTIONS ( option 'value' [, ... ] ) ] [ COLLATE collation ] [ column_constraint [ ... ] ]
    | table_constraint }
    [, ... ]
] )
[ INHERITS ( parent_table [, ... ] ) ]
  SERVER server_name [ OPTIONS ( option 'value' [, ... ] ) ]
```

`column_constraint` is:

```sql
[ CONSTRAINT constraint_name ]
{ NOT NULL | NULL | CHECK (expr) [ NO INHERIT ] | DEFAULT default_expr }
```

`table_constraint` is:

```sql
[ CONSTRAINT constraint_name ] CHECK (expr) [ NO INHERIT ]
```

### Parameters

`table_name`

 Specify the name of the foreign table. Include a schema name to specify the schema in which the foreign table resides.

`IF NOT EXISTS`

 Include the `IF NOT EXISTS` clause to instruct the server to not return an error if a table with the same name already exists. If a table with the same name exists, the server issues a notice.

`column_name`

 Specify the name of a column in the new table. Each column must correspond to a column described on the MongoDB server.

`data_type`

 Specify the data type of the column. When possible, specify the same data type for each column on the Postgres server and the MongoDB server. If a data type with the same name isn't available, the Postgres server attempts to cast the data type to a type compatible with the MongoDB server. If the server can't identify a compatible data type, it returns an error.

`COLLATE collation`

 Include the `COLLATE` clause to assign a collation to the column. If not specified, the column data type's default collation is used.

`INHERITS (parent_table [, ... ])`

 Include the `INHERITS` clause to specify a list of tables from which the new foreign table inherits all columns. Parent tables can be plain tables or foreign tables.

`CONSTRAINT constraint_name`

 Specify an optional name for a column or table constraint. If not specified, the server generates a constraint name.

`NOT NULL`

 Include the `NOT NULL` keywords to indicate that the column isn't allowed to contain null values.

`NULL`

 Include the `NULL` keywords to indicate that the column is allowed to contain null values. This is the default.

`CHECK (expr) [NO INHERIT]`

 Use the `CHECK` clause to specify an expression that produces a Boolean result that each row in the table must satisfy. A check constraint specified as a column constraint must reference that column's value only, while an expression appearing in a table constraint can reference multiple columns.

 A `CHECK` expression can't contain subqueries or refer to variables other than columns of the current row.

 Include the `NO INHERIT` keywords to specify that a constraint can't propagate to child tables.

`DEFAULT default_expr`

 Include the `DEFAULT` clause to specify a default data value for the column whose column definition it appears in. The data type of the default expression must match the data type of the column.

`SERVER server_name [OPTIONS (option 'value' [, ... ] ) ]`

 To create a foreign table that allows you to query a table that resides on a MongoDB file system, include the `SERVER` clause and specify `server_name` for the foreign server that uses the MongoDB data adapter.

 Use the `OPTIONS` clause to specify the following options and their corresponding values:

| Option     | Value                                                                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| database   | The name of the database to query. The default value is `test`.                   |
| collection | The name of the collection to query. The default value is the foreign table name. |
| enable_join_pushdown | Similar to the server-level option but configured at table level. If `true`, pushes the join between two foreign tables from the same foreign server instead of fetching all the rows for both the tables and performing a join locally. You can also set this option for an individual table. In this case, if any of the tables involved in the join has set the option to `false`, then the join isn't pushed down. The table-level value of the option takes precedence over the server-level option value. Default is `true`. |

### Example

To use data that's stored on MongoDB server, you must create a table on the Postgres host that maps the columns of a MongoDB collection to the columns of a Postgres table. For example, for a MongoDB collection with the following definition:

```sql
db.warehouse.find
(
        {
                "warehouse_id" : 1
        }
).pretty()
{
        "_id" : ObjectId("53720b1904864dc1f5a571a0"),
        "warehouse_id" : 1,
        "warehouse_name" : "UPS",
        "warehouse_created" : ISODate("2014-12-12T07:12:10Z")
}
```

Execute a command on the Postgres server that creates a comparable table on the Postgres server:

```sql
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE warehouse
(
 _id               NAME,
 warehouse_id      INT,
 warehouse_name    TEXT,
 warehouse_created TIMESTAMPZ
)
SERVER mongo_server
OPTIONS (database 'db', collection 'warehouse');
```

The first column of the table must be `_id` of the type `name`.

Include the `SERVER` clause to specify the name of the database stored on the MongoDB server and the name of the table (`warehouse`) that corresponds to the table on the Postgres server.

For more information about using the `CREATE FOREIGN TABLE` command, see the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createforeigntable.html).

!!! Note
    MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper supports the write capability feature.

<div id="data_type_mappings" class="registered_link"></div>

### Data type mappings

When using the foreign data wrapper, you must create a table on the Postgres server that mirrors the table that resides on the MongoDB server. The MongoDB data wrapper converts the following MongoDB data types to the target Postgres type:

| MongoDB (BSON Type)          | Postgres                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| ARRAY                        | JSON                                     |
| BOOL                         | DOUBLE                                   |
| BINARY                       | BYTEA                                    |
| DATE_TIME                    | DATE/TIMESTAMP/TIMESTAMPTZ               |
| DOCUMENT                     | JSON                                     |
| DOUBLE                       | DOUBLE                                   |
| INT32                        | DOUBLE                                   |
| INT64                        | DOUBLE                                   |
| OID                          | NAME                                     |    
| UTF8                         | BPCHAR/VARCHAR/CHARCTER VARYING/TEXT     |

## DROP EXTENSION

Use the `DROP EXTENSION` command to remove an extension. To invoke the command, use your client of choice (for example, psql) to connect to the Postgres database from which you're dropping the MongoDB server, and run the command:

```sql
DROP EXTENSION [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ];
```

### Parameters

`IF EXISTS`

 Include the `IF EXISTS` clause to instruct the server to issue a notice instead of returning an error if an extension with the specified name doesn't exist.

`name`

 Optionally, specify the name of the installed extension. 

 `CASCADE`
