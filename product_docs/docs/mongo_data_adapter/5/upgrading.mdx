If you have an existing installation of MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper that you installed using the EDB repository, you can use the `upgrade` command to update your repository configuration file and then upgrade to a more recent product version. To start the process, open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter the commands applicable to the operating system and package manager used for the installation.

```shell
# Update your edb.repo file to access the current EDB repository
dnf upgrade edb-repo

# Upgrade to the latest version product 
dnf upgrade edb-as<xx>-mongo_fdw
# where <xx> is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version number
```
## On RHEL or CentOS or OL 7

```shell
# Update your edb.repo file to access the current EDB repository 
yum upgrade edb-repo

# Upgrade to the latest version product version
yum upgrade edb-as<xx>-mongo_fdw edb-libmongoc-libs
# where <xx> is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version number
