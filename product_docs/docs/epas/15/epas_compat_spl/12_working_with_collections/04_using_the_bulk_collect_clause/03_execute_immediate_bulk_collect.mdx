The `BULK COLLECT` clause can be used with a `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` statement to specify a collection to receive the returned rows.

```sql
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE '<sql_expression>;'
   BULK COLLECT INTO <collection> [,...]
   [USING {[<bind_type>] <bind_argument>} [, ...]}];
```

`collection` specifies the name of a collection.

Currently all the `bind_type` is ignored and `bind_argument` is treated as `IN OUT`.

If a single collection is specified, then `collection` may be a collection of a single field, or a collection of a record type; if more than one collection is specified, each `collection` must consist of a single field.
