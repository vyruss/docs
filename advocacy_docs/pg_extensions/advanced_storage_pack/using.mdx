The following are scenarios where the EDB Advances Storage Pack TAM would be useful.

 ## Autocluster

An example use case for the Autocluster TAM is with a Trades table where the application access pattern is to retrieve all the trades for a given stock symbol. The Autocluster TAM can be used so that the INSERTs store the rows of the given stock symbol in the same location in the database. As a result, fewer pages are accessed to retrieve all the trades, the database page cache is used more efficiently, and the application receives results from the database faster.

 ## Refdata

An example use case for the Refdata TAM is with an application where many tables have foreign keys to the StatesOfAmerica table. The table is likely to be accessed very regularly for reads and very rarely for writes. Hence the locking for the table is optimized for this use case.
