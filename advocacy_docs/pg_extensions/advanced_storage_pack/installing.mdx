The storage extensions are supported on the same platforms as the Postgres distribution you are using. Support for the extensions start with Postgres 11. For details, see:
- [EDB Postgres Advanced Server Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/platform-compatibility#epas)
- [PostgreSQL Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility#pg)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install Postgres
  - [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux/installing_epas_using_edb_repository/)
  - [Installing PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) 

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.



## Install the package

The syntax for the install command is:

```shell
sudo <package-manager> -y install <postgres><postgres_version>-<extension_name>-<extension_version>
```

where: 
- `<package-manager>`is the package manager used with your operating system:

  | Package manager |             Operating system     |
  | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
  | dnf             | RHEL 8 and derivatives           |
  | yum             | RHEL 7 and derivatives, CentOS 7 |
  | zypper          | SLES                             |
  | apt-get         | Debian and derivatives           |

- `postgres` is the distribution of Postgres you are using:

 |    Postgres distribution     |   Value    |
 | ---------------------------- | ---------- |
 | PostgreSQL                   | postgresql |
 | EDB Postgres Advanced Server | as         |

- `postgres_version` is the version of Postgres you are using.

- `extension_name` is the extension you are using: `autocluster` or `refdata`.

- `extension_version` is the version of the extension you are installing.

For example, to install the AutoCluster extension for EDB Postgres Advanced Server 14 on a RHEL 8 platform:

```
sudo dnf -y install as14-autocluster-1.0.0
```
