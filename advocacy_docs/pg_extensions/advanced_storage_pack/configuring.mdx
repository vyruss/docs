Place the extension module implementing the custom Table Access Method in `shared_preload_libraries` so that it loads early during the PostgreSQL startup. This step is necessary to ensure that the extension is available before the first access to a table based on the given TAM. For example, to load the autocluster TAM, add this line to `postgresql.conf`:

```ini
shared_preload_libraries = 'autocluster'
```

After restarting the server, execute the SQL command to create the extension. This command creates the extension only in the connected database where the SQL is executed, and must be rerun in each database where the extension used:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION autocluster;
```

Within databases where the extension has been created, tables can be created to use the TAM which the extension provides:

```sql
CREATE TABLE mytable USING autocluster;
```
