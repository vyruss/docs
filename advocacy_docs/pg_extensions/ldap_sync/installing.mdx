ldap-sync is supported on the same platforms as Postgres starting with version 12. See:
- [EDB Postgres Advanced Server Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/platform-compatibility#epas)
- [PostgreSQL Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility#pg)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install Postgres

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.



## Install the package

```shell
sudo <package-manager> -y install edb-ldap-sync
```

where `<package-manager>`is the package manager used with your operating system:

| Package manager |             Operating system     |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| dnf             | RHEL 8 and derivatives           |
| yum             | RHEL 7 and derivatives, CentOS 7 |
| zypper          | SLES                             |
