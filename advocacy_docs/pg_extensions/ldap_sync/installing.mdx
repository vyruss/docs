EDB LDAP Sync is supported on the same platforms as the Postgres distribution you are using. Support for EDB LDAP Sync starts with Postgres 11. See:
- [EDB Postgres Advanced Server Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/platform-compatibility#epas)

- [PostgreSQL Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility#pg)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install Postgres
  - [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux/installing_epas_using_edb_repository/)

  - [Installing PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) 

- Install [ldap2pg](https://ldap2pg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.


## Install the package

```shell
sudo <package-manager> -y install edb-ldap_sync-<version>
```

where `<package-manager>`is the package manager used with your operating system:

| Package manager |             Operating system     |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| dnf             | RHEL 8 and derivatives           |
| yum             | RHEL 7 and derivatives, CentOS 7 |
| zypper          | SLES                             |
| apt-get         | Debian and derivatives           |

For example, to install EDB LDAP Sync version 1.0.0 on a RHEL 8 platform:

```
sudo dnf -y install edb-ldap_sync-1.0.0
```
