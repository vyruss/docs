EDB LDAP Sync is supported on the same platforms as the Postgres distribution you are using, starting with version 11. See:
- [EDB Postgres Advanced Server Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/platform-compatibility#epas)

- [PostgreSQL Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility#pg)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install Postgres
  - [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux/installing_epas_using_edb_repository/)
  - [Installing PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) 

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.



## Install the package

```shell
sudo <package-manager> -y install edb-ldap-sync
```

where `<package-manager>`is the package manager used with your operating system:
