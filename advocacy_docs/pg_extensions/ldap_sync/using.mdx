LDAP Sync uses pgAgent to schedule credentials synchronizations between your database and server. 

`schedule_pgagent` sets up a synchronization schedule for ldap2pg. This utility uses syntax similar to cron and produces the SQL command `pgagent.sql`, which is loaded into the database. 

An example of a a schedule that runs every hour: 

```shell
schedule_pgagent "0 * * * *"
```

This command produces the  `pgagent.sql` file, which is loaded into the database with `enterprisedb` user credentials: 

```shell
psql < pgagent.sql
```
