To run EDB Postgres Tuner, it needs to be added to the `shared_preload_libraries` and the extension created in the database. Once done, EDB Postgres Tuner can gather metrics to make tuning recommendations. 

1. In the `postgresql.conf` file, add `pg_tuner` to the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter:

   ```ini
   shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_tuner'
   ```

   !!! Note
   If you have other extensions in `shared_preload_libraries`, then you can add `pg_tuner` to the list. The order doesn't matter. 
   !!!

1. Restart Postgres. 

1. Create the EDB Postgres Tuner extension in your database with the following command: 

   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION pg_tuner;
   ```
