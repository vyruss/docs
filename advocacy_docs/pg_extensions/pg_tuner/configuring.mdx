To run EDB Postgres Tuner, it needs to be added to the `shared_preload_libraries` and the extension created in the database. Once done, EDB Postgres Tuner can gather metrics to make tuning recommendations. 

1. In the `postgresql.conf` file, add `edb_pg_tuner` to the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter:

   ```ini
   shared_preload_libraries = 'edb_pg_tuner'
   ```

   !!! Note
   If you have other extensions in `shared_preload_libraries`, then you can add `edb_pg_tuner` to the list. The order doesn't matter. 
   !!!

1. Restart Postgres. 

1. Create the EDB Postgres Tuner extension in your database with the following command: 

   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION edb_pg_tuner;
   ```

## Parameters 

The following custom GUCs control the EDB Postgres Tuner extension behavior. If you modify these parameters, then reload Postgres to apply the changes. 

- `edb_pg_tuner.autotune` &mdash; Applies tuning recommendations automatically. The default is `false`. 

- `edb_pg_tuner.naptime` &mdash; Sets the interval between each check in seconds. The default is 600 seconds (10 minutes).

- `edb_pg_tuner.max_wal_size_limit` &mdash; Sets the maximum value for the `max_wal_size` recommendation. The default is `0`, which sets no limit.
