EDB Postgres Tuner is a PostgreSQL extension that automates 15+ years of EDB Postgres tuning experience. 

Postgres uses some conservative settings to cover different host sizes. Some of the settings provided by Postgres are unsuitable because they do not take advantage of the available resources. Configuration parameters set by `initdb` do not account for the amount of memory, the number of CPU cores, and the kind of storage devices available to set appropriate values for parameters. Some parameters are dependent on the workload. The workload will provide metrics that will be used to fine-tune some parameters dynamically.

In summary, this extension provides safe recommendations that maximize the use of available resources and allows the user to control if and when the changes will be applied. EDB Postgres Tuner enables you to apply tuning recommendations automatically, or view tuning recommendations and selectively apply them. It's now possible to successfully manage demanding Postgres databases without tuning expertise.
